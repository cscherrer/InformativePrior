# About Us

**Informative Prior** provides probabilistic modeling tools and services, including

- Model development and support,
- Custom software development, and
- Professional training. 

When possible, we make results available as open source software. This focuses around two packages in particular:

- [**Soss.jl**](https://github.com/cscherrer/Soss.jl) is a probabilistic programming language that dynamically generates specialized code for a given statistical model. Soss models are _first class_, allowing for a degree of flexibility not possible in most other systems. Soss is especially useful for decision making with uncertain information.
- [**MeasureTheory.jl**](https://github.com/cscherrer/MeasureTheory.jl) is a library for representing and manipulating _measures_, mathematical constructs that are a generalization of probability distributions. Soss uses this library as a foundation for many of its computations. 

Julia offers high-level code with high performance, and integrates with existing R, Python, and C software stacks.
